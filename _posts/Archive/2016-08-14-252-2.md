From the <strong>[Shepherd Police Department]</strong>(https://www.facebook.com/Shepherd-Police-Department-205632619455314/?fref=nf)

I did not personally know Retired Undersheriff Burns, but as a police officer we are all family and the Shepherd Police Department sends our thoughts and prayers to his family.

From what I have heard and read, I think this is fitting: You're born at Point A and you die at Point B, but it is what you in between that matters. Retired Undersheriff Burns did A LOT for the community through his service. Rest in Peace Sir!
